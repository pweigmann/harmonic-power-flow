# Harmonic-Power-Flow

Development repository for my Master thesis containing scripts to simulate circuits in MATLAB Simulink, calculate Norton Equivalent parameters and solve the harmonic power flow in Python.

The Julia version of the harmonic power flow solver and its documentation is available as [HarmonicPowerFlow.jl](https://github.com/pweigmann/HarmonicPowerFlow.jl).
